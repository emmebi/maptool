# How To Setup User Interface (UI) Tools for MapTool

MapTool uses Swing for its user interface (UI) components. This document provides instructions for
setting up the tools needed to work on the UI components of MapTool.
All of the Swing components are created using the IntelliJ IDEA GUI Designer. IntelliJ IDEA is
the recommended IDE for working on the MapTool project. JetBrains provides a Community Edition
of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) that is free to use. At time of
writing you need to scroll down the page a little to find the Community Edition download link.

There is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA called "UI Designer" that is required to work on the UI
components
of MapTool. The
following [tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/design-gui-using-swing.html#sections-of-a-form)
describes how to use the UI Designer.

Note that the UI Designer is only required if you plan to modify the UI, the project can be built
using gradle without needing either IntelliJ IDEA or the UI Designer.
