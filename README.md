# MapTool ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RPTools/MapTool)

Welcome to the MapTool repository! This is the official repository for the MapTool Virtual Tabletop

## So what is MapTool?

MapTool is intended for use in supporting table-top role playing games, such as D&D, PathFinder,
GURPS, Call of Cthulhu, Star Wars, Shadowrun, and many others. It is a mature and full-featured
Virtual
Tabletop (VTT) application that allows users to create, manage, and play their favorite pen and
paper
either in person or remotely.

Included are not only powerful tools for the creation of detailed maps, but also a chat function,
detailed token management (allowing you to track properties of the units placed on the map and
display health and status information), and an initiative tracker. Functions not being used can be
hidden out of sight. These features enable your computer screen to function as a virtual table-top,
fulfilling the role of battlemats and dry-erase markers and providing for infinitely scrollable maps
and the ability to use a large-screen TV or video projector. It is _game system agnostic_, meaning
that while MapTool has special support for some game systems (like hexes for GURPS or square
templates for D&D 4E) there is no requirement for you to use these features.

The best part is all this isn't limited to a single PC. You can utilize the integrated server
function to connect to players wherever there's an Internet connection. Miss your buddy in
Singapore? Not a problem. Roll up that character, and then your sleeves.

And we don't stop there! Not content with just emulating the tabletop, we seek to improve upon the
tabletop experience. This, truly, is where MapTool shines. A set of "topology" and vision features
enable the GM to limit the view of his players, revealing the map as they explore it. Walls and
other objects can prevent players from seeing what lies behind them. Darkness can be made to fall,
blinding players who lack a light. Lights can be set on objects or on tokens that illuminate however
much of the map you wish. If the GM wishes, s/he can limit the view of players to what their
specific token sees, adding a whole new level to the experience of splitting up the party. Woe be to
the character who can't see around the corner of a wall but steps out into the view of the enemy!
